Do not go gentle into that good night,

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

> 不要温和地走进那个良夜，

> 白昼将尽，暮年仍应燃烧咆哮;

> 怒斥吧，怒斥光的消逝。
 
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,

Because their words had forked no lightning they

Do not go gentle into that good night.

> 虽然在白昼尽头，智者自知该踏上夜途，

> 因为言语未曾迸发出电光，他们

> 不要温和地走进那个良夜。
 
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright

Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

> 好人，当最后一浪过去，高呼着他们脆弱的善行

> 本来也许可以在绿湾上快意地舞蹈，

> 所以，他们怒斥，怒斥光的消逝。
 
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,

And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,

Do not go gentle into that good night.

> 狂人抓住稍纵即逝的阳光，为之歌唱，
> 并意识到，太迟了，他们过去总为时光伤逝，
> 不要温和地走进那个良夜。
 
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight

Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

> 严肃的人，在生命尽头，用模糊的双眼看到

> 失明的眼可以像流星般闪耀，欢欣雀跃，

> 所以，他们怒斥，怒斥光的消逝。
 
And you, my father, there on the sad height,

Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
 
> 而您，我的父亲，在生命那悲哀之极，

> 我求您现在用您的热泪诅咒我，祝福我吧

> 不要温和地走进那个良夜。

> 怒斥吧，怒斥光的消逝。
